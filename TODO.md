# TODO: Implement RSVP Addition Section for Guest Display

## Tasks
- [ ] Add a new section in RSVPSection.tsx for additional input (e.g., a message or note)
- [ ] Update the form submission in RSVPSection.tsx to save additional data to localStorage
- [ ] Update Guest.tsx to display the additional data from RSVP submissions
- [ ] Test the functionality locally to ensure data flows from RSVP to Guest page

## Notes
- Use localStorage 'wedding_rsvp_list' for data persistence
- Extend the RSVP data structure to include additional fields
- Ensure compatibility with existing code
